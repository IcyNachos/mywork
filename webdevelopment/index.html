	<p> My character’s name is The Carrot Lord, they resemble a mix between demi-human and carrot. The carrot lord has no gender since they can morph between whatever they so be, that also mean changing ones DNA and anatomy. Their species is called “ The Flurs”. The character’s homeland is a place called The Garden, this planet is in a galaxy called saltwater. The galaxy Saltwater isn’t like any other galaxy, it’s inhabited buy several different lifeforms just to name some of the common ones, there are the Aqua Rock people ( they aren’t really people more like a mixture of seaweed that’s anchored down by rusted metal ). Then you have the oozy-goozy species, the oozy-goozy are proud beings that withhold all that is good. Every planet isn’t just owned by a species, its more clan based where all who devote themselves and are accepted by the clan may live there. The environment is a wildlife tree top community on the Garden that is separated from the ground by a deep dense fog, no one know what’s below the fog and no one is willing to find out. On a daily they go about their own lives, until the first of every millennium or so they have a great sacrifice to the god’s, no one has set eyes on them or anything no daily prayers or offerings are left for them. A sacrifice consist of every villagers favorite item no matter what it is. The carrot lord’s physical appearance is whatever they desire in that moment, but they have to maintain complete concentration and will power or the form wont hold. The energy/aura they give off is dark, its darker then the deepest depts of hell, but they have a heart of gold always wanting to help people. But will demeaned payment of sort after, they don’t want money but a limb of ones choice. Their movement is a mix of joyful and professional. His unusual power isn’t the ability to morph into anything, that’s something his species with training as they age. Their ability is absolute water control, say if they morphed into what we’d call a dragon they’d be a water dragon. Everyone in The Flur species has their own unique ability, some can control the weather, while other can only do the mundane stuff like flight or the ability to blend into any background as long as they don’t make any movement.</p>
